A production-style AI system that controls when an LLM should answer, refuse, or stop—using explicit decision gates, evaluation logic, and uncertainty handling.
# LLM Decision Control & Evaluation System

This repository contains a production-style AI system designed to control **when an LLM should answer, when it should refuse, and when it should stop**.

The system emphasizes:
- explicit decision gates before model invocation
- post-response evaluation and validation
- uncertainty-aware refusal as a valid outcome
- clear stop conditions instead of forced answers
- auditability and explainable control logic

This project focuses on **AI systems reliability and failure prevention**, not model training or prompt experimentation.

> Status: Architecture and control logic under active development.
